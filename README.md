# Plant_Disease_Project

The source of dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). The main challenges here is the imbalance dataset. One solution to handle the imbalance dataset is by implementing augmented technique to increase the number of dataset for the minority class. All the projects are:
1. [Potatoe disease classification using partial dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potatoes_disease_CNN.ipynb)
2. [Potatoe disease classification using all dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potatoe_disease_CNN_full_dataset.ipynb)
3. [Potatoe disease classification using the augmented technique for minority dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potato_disease_augmented.ipynb)
4. [Potatoe disease classification using pretrained model](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potato_disease_pre_trained_model.ipynb)
5. [Pepper, tomatoes and potatoe disease classification using all dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/all_diseases_all_dataset.ipynb)
6. [Pepper, tomatoes and potatoe disease classification using 152 dataset for each target](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/all_disease_152_Images.ipynb)
7. [Pepper, tomatoes and potatoe disease classification using pre trained model](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/all_plant_diseases_pretrained_model.ipynb)
