# Plant_Disease_Project

The source of dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). The main challenges here is the imbalance dataset. One solution is by implementing augmented technique to increase the number of dataset for the minority class. All the projects are:
1. [Potatoe disease classification using partial dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potatoes_disease_CNN.ipynb)
2. [Potatoe disease classification using all dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potatoe_disease_CNN_full_dataset.ipynb)
3. [Potatoe disease classification using the augmented technique for minority dataset](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potato_disease_augmented.ipynb)
4. [Potatoe disease classification using pretrained model](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Plant_Disease_Project/blob/main/potato_disease_pre_trained_model.ipynb)
5. [Pepper, tomatoes and potatoe disease classification]()
